# Part 4 Project Group 58

## The reconstruction of speech/voice with the use of noise-cancelling algorithms and machine learning

Team members: Edward Chan and Timothy Aguana Cabrera

Abstract:

## Structure
The repository has the following structure
- [Creating-Dataset](Creating-Dataset): Contains a python program used to generate the dataset to train and test models
- [Dataset](Dataset): Where the training dataset is generated after using [Creating-Dataset](Creating-Dataset) and where evaluation wav files should be placed
- [Evaluation](Evaluation): Contains a python program used to perform speech enhancement and generate the evaluation of one or more audio wav files
- [Exhibition-Day-Presentation](Exhibition-Day-Presentation): Contains the exhibition presentation and poster
- [Models-Setup](Models-Setup): Contains python code for both training both the GAN and the CNN models
- [Models](Models): Where models generated by [Models-Setup](Models-Setup) is kept and loaded from
- [Others](Others): Stores progression documentation, presentation and flowcharts
- [Project-Compendium-Report](Project-Compendium-Report): Contains the report of the overall compendium
- [Results](Results): CNN classification results, GAN results and the overall system evaluation results
- [Seminar-Presentation](Seminar-Presentation): The presentation slides for the mid-year seminar

## Packages

## Getting Started

### Creating Dataset
- Go to [Creating-Dataset](Creating-Dataset)
- Open create-dataset.ipynb
- Download the [speech dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/showmik50/vctk-dataset) and [noise dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chrisfilo/demand)
- Extract these folders place them in [Creating-Dataset](Creating-Dataset) (Create a new folder called "noisy" and extract the noisy dataset in the folder)
- In Step 5 change the number of samples to create to you desired value `n = 1500`
- Then Run All

### Generating CNN Classification Model
- Go to [Classification-Setup](Models-Setup/Classification-Setup)
- Open class_model.ipynb
- In Step 4 change the batch_size and epoch number to your desired value `batch_size=10, epochs=20`
- Change model name in Step 6 to your desired name `model.save(model_path + 'my_model.h5')`
- Run from Step 1 to Step 6 to save model (Step 7 loads the model and predicts the SNR levels for all wav files in `path_test_dataset = "../../Dataset/predict_dataset/"`)

### Generating GAN Speech Enhancement Model

### Perform Evaluation

## Future Improvements

## Key Notes
- We created this program using Windows 10

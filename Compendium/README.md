Team members: Edward Chan and Timothy Aguana Cabrera

Abstract:

## Structure
The repository has the following structure
- [Creating-Dataset](Creating-Dataset): Contains a python program used to generate the dataset to train and test models
- [Dataset](Dataset): Where the training dataset is generated after using [Creating-Dataset](Creating-Dataset) and where evaluation wav files should be placed
- [Evaluation](Evaluation): Contains a python program used to perform speech enhancement and generate the evaluation of one or more audio wav files
- [Exhibition-Day-Presentation](Exhibition-Day-Presentation): Contains the exhibition presentation and poster
- [Models-Setup](Models-Setup): Contains python code for both training both the GAN and the CNN models
- [Models](Models): Where models generated by [Models-Setup](Models-Setup) is kept and loaded from
- [Others](Others): Stores progression documentation, presentation and flowcharts
- [Project-Compendium-Report](Project-Compendium-Report): Contains the report of the overall compendium
- [Results](Results): CNN classification results, GAN results and the overall system evaluation results
- [Seminar-Presentation](Seminar-Presentation): The presentation slides for the mid-year seminar
